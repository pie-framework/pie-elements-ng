# @pie-lib/math-input

## 9.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#145](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/145) [`ed2cbd6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/ed2cbd602546d5baf3c3181d318ae8c7b04bd608) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Move the `@pie-lib` packages onto version bases the legacy pie-lib lineage does not publish into, so a bump can no longer land on a version number npm already holds (PIE-1041).
  
  Both repos publish these names and both increment the same `<base>-next.N` series, with legacy's counter far ahead of this repo's. When a bump lands on a number legacy already published, npm refuses the overwrite, the package is never published from here, and every element that pins it silently resolves the legacy build instead — which is how `next.9` shipped elements linked against June 2026 lib code, failed 25 of 172 bundle combinations, and left the inline-dropdown, keyboard-placement, selected-choice, drag-placeholder and graphing-palette fixes out of the bundles despite them being on develop.
  
  A major takes each package to a base legacy has never used, which removes both the collision on publish and the caret eviction that follows it: legacy packages stop entering the dependency graph, so their `^` ranges — which exclude this repo's prereleases and resolve to legacy stables — stop being consulted at all. This is a version-coordination change only; no runtime behaviour changes.

### Patch Changes

- [#31](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/31) [`b34750c`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/b34750cda5fb9ba30b844a8fe646bb0f91f1f50a) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Publish ng ESM builds for PIE lib packages

- [#198](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/198) [`7abcbd2`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/7abcbd20a631a99df3c58158eaee953596615633) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

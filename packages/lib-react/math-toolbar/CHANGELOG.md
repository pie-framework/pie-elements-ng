### Patch Changes

- [#328](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/328) [`2405ee9`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/2405ee9b4c97246caf8c8df342b7639fe789de5c) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - The extended-text-entry annotation menu has a [#757575](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/issues/757575) outline and pointer, and the freeform annotation editor keeps its green or pink band between two [#757575](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/issues/757575) rings, so both meet 3:1 against the annotation colours, the page and the menu in every theme. The math toolbar's Done check is a darker green (#388E3C) that meets 3:1 on the toolbar, on white and under the dark theme, and the editor toolbar's Done check takes the same green unless a host sets `--editable-html-toolbar-check`. The video transcript toggle's border takes the text colour, and with no theme applied the toggle and the video retry button now show a border in the surrounding text colour.

- [#380](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/380) [`f9cfed6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/f9cfed6062b8cf78a9da91e7821c13232793717f) Thanks [@PatriciaRomaniuc](https://github.com/PatriciaRomaniuc)! - The math-inline and math-templated authoring Correct Answer card follows the theme: its fill is `--pie-background` and its text, labels and select read `--pie-text`, so under a dark preset the card darkens with the page instead of staying white behind the dark editor and keypad. With no theme the card stays white. Its validation messages take `--pie-incorrect-icon` instead of MUI's fixed red, which fell below 4.5:1 on dark backgrounds. The math-toolbar Done check now takes the theme's correct-icon colour (`--pie-correct-icon`) and clears 3:1 (WCAG 1.4.11) on the card and on the editable-html toolbar fill under every preset and colour scheme.

- [#268](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/268) [`cf1ccc0`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/cf1ccc0d25c0c136dc01dab014c68a083ed595ed) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - chore: remove upstream sync tooling (PIE-1144)

### Major Changes

- [#145](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/145) [`ed2cbd6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/ed2cbd602546d5baf3c3181d318ae8c7b04bd608) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Move the `@pie-lib` packages onto version bases the legacy pie-lib lineage does not publish into, so a bump can no longer land on a version number npm already holds (PIE-1041).
  
  Both repos publish these names and both increment the same `<base>-next.N` series, with legacy's counter far ahead of this repo's. When a bump lands on a number legacy already published, npm refuses the overwrite, the package is never published from here, and every element that pins it silently resolves the legacy build instead — which is how `next.9` shipped elements linked against June 2026 lib code, failed 25 of 172 bundle combinations, and left the inline-dropdown, keyboard-placement, selected-choice, drag-placeholder and graphing-palette fixes out of the bundles despite them being on develop.
  
  A major takes each package to a base legacy has never used, which removes both the collision on publish and the caret eviction that follows it: legacy packages stop entering the dependency graph, so their `^` ranges — which exclude this repo's prereleases and resolve to legacy stables — stop being consulted at all. This is a version-coordination change only; no runtime behaviour changes.

### Patch Changes

- [#31](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/31) [`b34750c`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/b34750cda5fb9ba30b844a8fe646bb0f91f1f50a) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Publish ng ESM builds for PIE lib packages

- [#88](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/88) [`d6e12a5`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/d6e12a5e47e15a93507d7ef5a9eeeee02f230229) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - React element colours drawn from MUI's grey palette now follow the active colour scheme.
  
  `theme.palette.grey[N]` does not track `--pie-*`, so every one of these borders, fills
  and glyphs held a single hex under all ten schemes. Measured against each scheme's own
  `--pie-background`, the worst case per site ran between 1.01:1 and 1.72:1 — the
  answer-choice separator in `multiple-choice` that George reported was the visible end of
  it, not an isolated defect. Each site now reads the token matching its role, and the
  worst case across every scheme is at least 3.17:1.
  
  Strokes, dividers and connectors take `--pie-border`; the heavier card outlines in
  `math-inline` and `math-templated` take `--pie-border-dark`. Fills take
  `--pie-background-dark`, and selected or pressed fills `--pie-dropdown-background`. Text
  and interactive icons take `--pie-text` — no neutral token clears 4.5:1 in every scheme,
  so the `likert` column header that measured 1.88:1 on plain white gains contrast rather
  than keeping its tint. De-emphasised glyphs take `--pie-border-gray`, disabled
  affordances `--pie-disabled`.
  
  Four surfaces move with their strokes, because a scheme's border colour on a permanently
  white card is worse than the grey it replaced: under white-on-black `--pie-border` is
  `#ffffff`. The two `extended-text-entry` annotation popovers, the `inline-dropdown` menu
  item and the `config-ui` settings panel now paint `--pie-white`, which inverts with the
  scheme as `palette.common.white` never did.
  
  `@pie-lib/render-ui` gains `color.buttonFocusOutline()` for `--pie-button-focus-outline`,
  used by the two editor toolbar focus rings that were drawing themselves in `grey[700]` —
  1.28:1 on yellow-on-navy.
  
  Visible change in the default light theme: strokes that were `#e0e0e0` or `#bdbdbd` are
  now `--pie-border`, which resolves to `#8f8f8f`. That is deliberate; the previous values
  were below the 3:1 non-text minimum before any scheme was applied.

Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

  `--pie-background`, the worst case per site ran between 1.01:1 and 1.72:1 — the
  answer-choice separator in `multiple-choice` that George reported was the visible end of
  it, not an isolated defect. Each site now reads the token matching its role, and the
  worst case across every scheme is at least 3.17:1.

  Strokes, dividers and connectors take `--pie-border`; the heavier card outlines in
  `math-inline` and `math-templated` take `--pie-border-dark`. Fills take
  `--pie-background-dark`, and selected or pressed fills `--pie-dropdown-background`. Text
  and interactive icons take `--pie-text` — no neutral token clears 4.5:1 in every scheme,
  so the `likert` column header that measured 1.88:1 on plain white gains contrast rather
  than keeping its tint. De-emphasised glyphs take `--pie-border-gray`, disabled
  affordances `--pie-disabled`.

  Four surfaces move with their strokes, because a scheme's border colour on a permanently
  white card is worse than the grey it replaced: under white-on-black `--pie-border` is
  `#ffffff`. The two `extended-text-entry` annotation popovers, the `inline-dropdown` menu
  item and the `config-ui` settings panel now paint `--pie-white`, which inverts with the
  scheme as `palette.common.white` never did.

  `@pie-lib/render-ui` gains `color.buttonFocusOutline()` for `--pie-button-focus-outline`,
  used by the two editor toolbar focus rings that were drawing themselves in `grey[700]` —
  1.28:1 on yellow-on-navy.

  Visible change in the default light theme: strokes that were `#e0e0e0` or `#bdbdbd` are
  now `--pie-border`, which resolves to `#8f8f8f`. That is deliberate; the previous values
  were below the 3:1 non-text minimum before any scheme was applied.

### Patch Changes

- a4c6279: Vendor the lodash helper surface through `@pie-element/shared-lodash` so browser ESM output no longer depends on runtime lodash or lodash-es resolution.

  Replace `@pie-lib/config-ui`'s tiny `mathjs` fraction-to-number usage with a generated local helper, while keeping `mathjs@^15.2.0` for packages such as `@pie-element/number-line` that use the broader math surface.

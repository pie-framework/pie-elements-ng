# @pie-element/simple-cloze

## 0.1.4-next.20

### Patch Changes

- cd1f4f9: When a page installs the adapter's own `renderMath` as its math renderer, at `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering']` or, for elements inside `<pie-print>`, at `window.renderMath`, the adapter now typesets with its own MathJax. It previously called itself without end, which overflowed the stack or hung the page.

## 0.1.4-next.19

### Patch Changes

- 3bad6b6: Print modules rendered by the `@pie-framework/pie-print` print player typeset their math through that player's renderer, waiting up to 10 seconds while the player imports it. Math previously stayed untypeset there, because the element's MathJax 4 does not start on a page that already holds the player's MathJax 3.

## 0.1.4-next.18

### Patch Changes

- define and enforce packaging contracts PIE-626
- Prepare all PIE element packages for the next prerelease patch wave
- Trigger the next prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.
- Trigger another prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.
- The Svelte delivery elements write each session update into the object the player handed them, through the new `writeSessionInPlace` in `@pie-lib/delivery-events-svelte` (PIE-1058).
  
  A player reads the learner's response back off that object, so replacing the reference left the player's entry at its load-time value and the forwarded container normalized to `session: null` with `intent: "metadata-only"`. All three elements-svelte packages shared the defect, and `mc-populated-blank`'s audio handlers dropped `audioStartTime`/`audioEndTime` the same way.
  
  The elements-svelte packages do not adopt `createSessionNotifier`: they dispatch synchronously, so installing `commitPendingSession()` would tell a player they had committed when nothing was pending.
- The rich-text editor shows its `placeholder` while empty, as the React editor does; the prop was accepted and never displayed (PIE-1075).
- The rich-text editor's Done and alignment buttons take the editor stylesheet's padding, colours and hover states, which hard-coded inline styles overrode (PIE-1075).
- Leave the session's `element` to the player (PIE-1075).
- Scoring, accessibility, styling and authoring fixes.
- The session stores the answer as `value`, as the React elements do, where it was `response`; hosts that read it must switch. Answers now compare as plain text, so an answer key authored as HTML matches what the learner types; an unanswered response can be revealed in evaluate mode; the prompt renders math; and `model-set` reports a restored answer as complete. Instructors see teacher instructions, collapsed in delivery and printed, including when `teacherInstructionsEnabled` is unset (PIE-1075).
- Take learner-facing strings from `@pie-lib/translator` in the item's `language`, as the React elements do. mc-populated-blank no longer reads `uiText`, and uses `locale` when `language` is unset.
- Pin every @tiptap/\* dependency to exactly 3.31.3, so installing more than one PIE element resolves a single @tiptap/core instead of three. tiptap pins its own peers exactly from 3.24.0 on, so a mixed set cannot be satisfied and the duplicate core breaks ProseMirror on schema and plugin identity. Also dedupes prosemirror-model and prosemirror-view, which tiptap was warning about ("wrapping and splitting nodes will fail"). element-player drops its 8 @tiptap/\* dependencies plus lowlight and highlight.js: they were only reachable from an orphaned JsonEditor/ModelInspector pair that nothing imported, so none of them ever reached its bundle (PIE-1042)
- `defineDeliveryElement` builds a Svelte delivery element from its component and an `isComplete` rule, and hands the component `onSessionChange` as a prop. `resolveDeliveryHost`, `forwardSessionChange` and `DeliveryHostElement` are removed. The three Svelte elements are built on it: `element.session` returns the player's session object after an update, and mc-populated-blank's `model-set` now reports a restored response as complete.
- The authoring view's Correct Answer field styles itself, so it keeps its layout and border in hosts that load no Tailwind or daisyUI.
- The package root re-exports `./delivery/index.js` instead of bundling a second copy of it, so `@pie-element/<name>` and `@pie-element/<name>/delivery` export the same element class. `dist/index.js.map` is no longer published.
- Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.
- Add `@pie-element/shared-editor-runtime`, one browser ESM build of the tiptap editor engine, and an editor-runtime variant of each browser view of the elements that bundle the engine, declared in `pie.browserEditorRuntime`, which `pie-cli` sync now writes. `./browser/*` and the IIFE builds are unchanged.
- Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, on the first render, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it. As under IIFE, single `$…$` stays text unless the page sets `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering@2'] = { opts: { useSingleDollar: true } }`, `\abs` is defined, and math carries hidden MathML for screen readers with no tab stops and no generated speech. No speech worker starts, so no `worker-src blob:` CSP entry is needed.
- MathJax starts loading on the first render whatever the element holds, so math that appears later does not wait on the download. Renders without math return without waiting on it.
- The `./browser/*` exports declare `types`, pointing at the declarations of the matching `./delivery`, `./author`, `./controller` and `./print` entries.
- Shipped type declarations resolve for a client that installs only the package: `@pie-lib/delivery-events-svelte`, which the delivery types reference, is now a dependency, and relative declaration imports carry their `.js` extension for `moduleResolution: node16`.
- Keep MathJax 4 output intact on pages that also run MathJax 3: typeset output carries no `data-latex` attributes, and the MathJax the adapter loads writes its styles to `<style id="PIE-MJX-CHTML-styles">`. Such pages remain unsupported; the adapter logs one `console.error` naming the conflict and dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict` on `window` for each condition it detects (exported as `MATHJAX_CONFLICT_EVENT`).
- Merge pull request #210 from pie-framework/dependabot/github_actions/actions/cache-6
- b6ef8b1: Element math rendered through a player's MathJax 3 renderer, as on `iife` pages, no longer logs an unsupported-page `console.error` or dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict`. The adapter still reports MathJax 4 meeting MathJax 3.
- Publish a root `print.js` shim from print-bearing elements, and resolve bundler entry
  subpaths from what a package declares.
  
  An alias-based IIFE builder resolves `@pie-element/<element>/print` as a filesystem path
  and never reads the exports map, so print needs the same root shim `controller.js` and
  `configure.js` already provide. Without it the subpath resolved only from TypeScript
  sources, so print worked in a workspace build and failed every build against published
  tarballs — taking the whole bundle with it rather than just the print view.
- Author elements take `configuration` as the React author elements do: an entry's `label` names its field and setting, `settings: true` offers the setting in a settings panel, and `settingsPanelDisabled` hides the panel. simple-cloze and venn-classification gain a teacher-instructions editor, and venn-classification's scoring policy moves into the panel.
- Author elements dispatch each edit as a bubbling `model.updated` from the element itself and keep the edit as the element's `model` across a detach and re-attach. venn-classification fills missing fields from its controller defaults, and mc-populated-blank's placeholder author view declares `model` and `configuration` and reports browser-ESM authoring unsupported.

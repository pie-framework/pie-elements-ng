# @pie-element/venn-classification

## 0.1.1-next.5

### Patch Changes

- ea07637: The Svelte delivery elements write each session update into the object the player handed them, through the new `writeSessionInPlace` in `@pie-lib/delivery-events-svelte` (PIE-1058).

  A player reads the learner's response back off that object, so replacing the reference left the player's entry at its load-time value and the forwarded container normalized to `session: null` with `intent: "metadata-only"`. All three elements-svelte packages shared the defect, and `mc-populated-blank`'s audio handlers dropped `audioStartTime`/`audioEndTime` the same way.

  The elements-svelte packages do not adopt `createSessionNotifier`: they dispatch synchronously, so installing `commitPendingSession()` would tell a player they had committed when nothing was pending.

## 0.1.1-next.4

### Patch Changes

- 7634975: Fix: bring the Svelte elements' `--pie-*` reads back inside the pie-players theming contract (PIE-857)

  The `--pie-correct-answer-*` family was invented by these packages, so the
  `pie-players` token registry could not see it and no color scheme overrode it.
  The 13 names are retired; `mc-populated-blank` now reads the canonical tokens
  they indirected through (`--pie-correct-secondary`, `--pie-incorrect-icon`,
  `--pie-tertiary-light`, and so on) with the canonical defaults as fallbacks.
  Resolved colors are unchanged under a themed host.

  Focus outlines no longer hardcode a blue. `mc-populated-blank` read
  `--pie-focus`, which nothing defines, and `venn-classification` used a literal
  `#2563eb` in four places; both now chain through `--pie-focus-outline`,
  `--pie-button-focus-outline`, and `--pie-focus-checked-border`, so the outline
  follows the active color scheme.

  `@pie-lib/styling-svelte` drops `correctAnswerTokens`, `CorrectAnswerTokens`,
  and `correctAnswerTokensToCssVars`, which defined the retired family and had no
  importers.

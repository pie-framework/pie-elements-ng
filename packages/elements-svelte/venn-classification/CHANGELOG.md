# @pie-element/venn-classification

## 0.1.1-next.8

### Patch Changes

- 53bed4b: `defineDeliveryElement` builds a Svelte delivery element from its component and an `isComplete` rule, and hands the component `onSessionChange` as a prop. `resolveDeliveryHost`, `forwardSessionChange` and `DeliveryHostElement` are removed. The three Svelte elements are built on it: `element.session` returns the player's session object after an update, and mc-populated-blank's `model-set` now reports a restored response as complete.
- 34065a2: The package root re-exports `./delivery/index.js` instead of bundling a second copy of it, so `@pie-element/<name>` and `@pie-element/<name>/delivery` export the same element class. `dist/index.js.map` is no longer published.

## 0.1.1-next.7

### Patch Changes

- 85910c0: The rich-text editor shows its `placeholder` while empty, as the React editor does; the prop was accepted and never displayed (PIE-1075).
- 3f989fb: The rich-text editor's Done and alignment buttons take the editor stylesheet's padding, colours and hover states, which hard-coded inline styles overrode (PIE-1075).
- a84b6c5: Leave the session's `element` to the player (PIE-1075).
- 2bb02ad: Take learner-facing strings from `@pie-lib/translator` in the item's `language`, as the React elements do. mc-populated-blank no longer reads `uiText`, and uses `locale` when `language` is unset.
- cee9377: Session, scoring, accessibility and authoring fixes.
- 681c694: Placed tiles stay inside their region, with the diagram growing when a region fills, and every drop zone is at least 120×120 px. Screen-reader activation picks up and drops tiles, the author preview uses region-label overrides, and a restored complete session reports `complete: true` on load. Instructors see teacher instructions, collapsed, including when `teacherInstructionsEnabled` is unset (PIE-1075).

## 0.1.1-next.6

### Patch Changes

- d22cfb1: Pin every @tiptap/\* dependency to exactly 3.31.3, so installing more than one PIE element resolves a single @tiptap/core instead of three. tiptap pins its own peers exactly from 3.24.0 on, so a mixed set cannot be satisfied and the duplicate core breaks ProseMirror on schema and plugin identity. Also dedupes prosemirror-model and prosemirror-view, which tiptap was warning about ("wrapping and splitting nodes will fail"). element-player drops its 8 @tiptap/\* dependencies plus lowlight and highlight.js: they were only reachable from an orphaned JsonEditor/ModelInspector pair that nothing imported, so none of them ever reached its bundle (PIE-1042)

## 0.1.1-next.5

### Patch Changes

- ea07637: The Svelte delivery elements write each session update into the object the player handed them, through the new `writeSessionInPlace` in `@pie-lib/delivery-events-svelte` (PIE-1058).

  A player reads the learner's response back off that object, so replacing the reference left the player's entry at its load-time value and the forwarded container normalized to `session: null` with `intent: "metadata-only"`. All three elements-svelte packages shared the defect, and `mc-populated-blank`'s audio handlers dropped `audioStartTime`/`audioEndTime` the same way.

  The elements-svelte packages do not adopt `createSessionNotifier`: they dispatch synchronously, so installing `commitPendingSession()` would tell a player they had committed when nothing was pending.

## 0.1.1-next.4

### Patch Changes

- 7634975: Fix: bring the Svelte elements' `--pie-*` reads back inside the pie-players theming contract (PIE-857)

  The `--pie-correct-answer-*` family was invented by these packages, so the
  `pie-players` token registry could not see it and no color scheme overrode it.
  The 13 names are retired; `mc-populated-blank` now reads the canonical tokens
  they indirected through (`--pie-correct-secondary`, `--pie-incorrect-icon`,
  `--pie-tertiary-light`, and so on) with the canonical defaults as fallbacks.
  Resolved colors are unchanged under a themed host.

  Focus outlines no longer hardcode a blue. `mc-populated-blank` read
  `--pie-focus`, which nothing defines, and `venn-classification` used a literal
  `#2563eb` in four places; both now chain through `--pie-focus-outline`,
  `--pie-button-focus-outline`, and `--pie-focus-checked-border`, so the outline
  follows the active color scheme.

  `@pie-lib/styling-svelte` drops `correctAnswerTokens`, `CorrectAnswerTokens`,
  and `correctAnswerTokensToCssVars`, which defined the retired family and had no
  importers.

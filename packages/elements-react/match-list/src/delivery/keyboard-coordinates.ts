/**
 * Custom keyboard coordinate getter for non-sortable drag-and-drop.
 *
 * Tab/Shift+Tab cycle the dragged item directly onto the next/previous droppable
 * (response area or the choices pool), in DOM order, placing the dragged item's own
 * top-left corner at the target's center-left point. Arrow keys are left doing plain
 * free-form movement (nudging the dragged item by a fixed step, same as dnd-kit's own
 * default keyboard behavior) rather than jumping between droppables — collision
 * detection (rectIntersection) still picks up whatever the item ends up actually
 * overlapping.

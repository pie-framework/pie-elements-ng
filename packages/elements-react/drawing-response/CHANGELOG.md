# @pie-element/drawing-response

## 13.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#261](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/261) [`29d19da`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/29d19daf732eb4cff629084534cdbf0d27f0acb1) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - First stable release built from pie-elements-ng, which replaces the pie-elements and pie-lib builds of this package.
  
  It is a new major version, above every version those repositories published, so existing `^` ranges on the earlier line keep resolving the earlier builds. Moving to this version is opt-in.

### Patch Changes

- [#33](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/33) [`33d27e0`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/33d27e0e13954e986a4a7e8a45e7508f1628712b) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - define and enforce packaging contracts PIE-626

- [#59](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/59) [`0bcd6d8`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/0bcd6d84612ba583d6248041d395ab753ab946de) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Publish corrected React element next prereleases from stable npm baselines.

- [#35](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/35) [`b82e87c`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/b82e87c1bd6c138b3d88bdb69b12731795ba9297) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Prepare all PIE element packages for the next prerelease patch wave

- [#59](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/59) [`fbf3695`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/fbf3695636c20afa6a31655c5f1a1d6ed130a374) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Trigger the next prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.

- [#59](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/59) [`d0f8d8e`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/d0f8d8ead911f8c6256a4898a2f6b6863b7538ac) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Trigger another prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.

- [#95](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/95) [`a644ec3`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/a644ec3877219c3f9220483640ce031993441580) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Declare react and react-dom as installable dependencies pinned to the browser ESM shared version (18.2.0), not peer-only. Legacy webpack bundlers install dependencies and never peers, so peer-only React left node_modules/react absent and every @mui/@emotion/@dnd-kit peer failed to resolve. Bundle output is unchanged - React stays external in every build.

- [#265](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/265) [`82406bf`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/82406bf47738f81d020706b639f5f22748bcd5d0) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Merge pull request [#175](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/issues/175) from pie-framework/fix/author-shim-cross-element-bundles

- [#195](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/195) [`473da8e`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/473da8e7c62e0ffd80001673c2df4fab79d2ec4d) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Browser ESM and legacy print bundles install the stylesheets they import, MathQuill's among them, so math fields render styled in the player and in hosts that bundle the elements with Vite or webpack. MathQuill's font ships as a WOFF2 file beside the bundle.

- [#198](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/198) [`7abcbd2`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/7abcbd20a631a99df3c58158eaee953596615633) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

- [#265](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/265) [`7f5b63d`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/7f5b63d4207ab434d313295a9cf582fc612e14ba) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Merge pull request [#131](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/issues/131) from pie-framework/dependabot/bun/vitejs/plugin-react-6.1.1

- [#199](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/199) [`c4e2ba3`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/c4e2ba313d3137c90af800715606e3f372e4beac) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Add `@pie-element/shared-editor-runtime`, one browser ESM build of the tiptap editor engine, and an editor-runtime variant of each browser view of the elements that bundle the engine, declared in `pie.browserEditorRuntime`, which `pie-cli` sync now writes. `./browser/*` and the IIFE builds are unchanged.

- [#205](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/205) [`6ed08c4`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/6ed08c43bbfd26b6bcc34f50e0e6760ec02fe704) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, on the first render, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it. As under IIFE, single `$…$` stays text unless the page sets `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering@2'] = { opts: { useSingleDollar: true } }`, `\abs` is defined, and math carries hidden MathML for screen readers with no tab stops and no generated speech. No speech worker starts, so no `worker-src blob:` CSP entry is needed.

- [#208](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/208) [`80e386a`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/80e386ac213e0ed6e19168fa12d9e9e08e64c0b6) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - MathJax starts loading on the first render whatever the element holds, so math that appears later does not wait on the download. Renders without math return without waiting on it.

- [#204](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/204) [`f64aeac`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/f64aeac84eef164000a855e6ac2842d0067e26aa) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - The `./browser/*` exports declare `types`, pointing at the declarations of the matching `./delivery`, `./author`, `./controller` and `./print` entries.

- [#217](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/217) [`269257a`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/269257a68d5aa5c5211b0e119b2f83927bfcde50) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Elements declare React and React DOM as dependencies only. The React peer they also declared let pnpm and yarn bind an element to the host's React; each element now runs on the React 18 it installs.

- [#225](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/225) [`54541e0`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/54541e041f18eeb625b517d95387e05102ce3e02) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Keep MathJax 4 output intact on pages that also run MathJax 3: typeset output carries no `data-latex` attributes, and the MathJax the adapter loads writes its styles to `<style id="PIE-MJX-CHTML-styles">`. Such pages remain unsupported; the adapter logs one `console.error` naming the conflict and dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict` on `window` for each condition it detects (exported as `MATHJAX_CONFLICT_EVENT`).

- [#209](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/209) [`76a2592`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/76a2592d4e46392e148c6e31b7559dfec3a95296) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Fix `dist/index.iife.js`, which threw on load (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'isRequired')`) and never defined its global or element. The `prop-types` and `debug` stand-ins in the IIFE build now match the real packages' production behaviour.

- [#232](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/232) [`b6ef8b1`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/b6ef8b1c432787df49293b9271b4bace5cd60d50) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Element math rendered through a player's MathJax 3 renderer, as on `iife` pages, no longer logs an unsupported-page `console.error` or dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict`. The adapter still reports MathJax 4 meeting MathJax 3.

- [#248](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/248) [`3bad6b6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/3bad6b6d27789a9c7d165d465f4846ce6d97d651) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Print modules rendered by the `@pie-framework/pie-print` print player typeset their math through that player's renderer, waiting up to 10 seconds while the player imports it. Math previously stayed untypeset there, because the element's MathJax 4 does not start on a page that already holds the player's MathJax 3.

- [#251](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/251) [`cd1f4f9`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/cd1f4f9c26d72be0a486ab17d8d56ba529056755) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - When a page installs the adapter's own `renderMath` as its math renderer, at `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering']` or, for elements inside `<pie-print>`, at `window.renderMath`, the adapter now typesets with its own MathJax. It previously called itself without end, which overflowed the stack or hung the page.

- [#35](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/35) [`a4c6279`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/a4c6279fa4175905f52c0696ae92eb53b21a6ce4) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Vendor the lodash helper surface through `@pie-element/shared-lodash` so browser ESM output no longer depends on runtime lodash or lodash-es resolution.
  
  Replace `@pie-lib/config-ui`'s tiny `mathjs` fraction-to-number usage with a generated local helper, while keeping `mathjs@^15.2.0` for packages such as `@pie-element/number-line` that use the broader math surface.

### Patch Changes

- define and enforce packaging contracts PIE-626
- Publish corrected React element next prereleases from stable npm baselines.
- Prepare all PIE element packages for the next prerelease patch wave
- Trigger the next prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.
- Trigger another prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.
- Declare react and react-dom as installable dependencies pinned to the browser ESM shared version (18.2.0), not peer-only. Legacy webpack bundlers install dependencies and never peers, so peer-only React left node_modules/react absent and every @mui/@emotion/@dnd-kit peer failed to resolve. Bundle output is unchanged - React stays external in every build.
- Merge pull request #175 from pie-framework/fix/author-shim-cross-element-bundles
- Browser ESM and legacy print bundles install the stylesheets they import, MathQuill's among them, so math fields render styled in the player and in hosts that bundle the elements with Vite or webpack. MathQuill's font ships as a WOFF2 file beside the bundle.
- Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.
- Merge pull request #131 from pie-framework/dependabot/bun/vitejs/plugin-react-6.1.1
- Add `@pie-element/shared-editor-runtime`, one browser ESM build of the tiptap editor engine, and an editor-runtime variant of each browser view of the elements that bundle the engine, declared in `pie.browserEditorRuntime`, which `pie-cli` sync now writes. `./browser/*` and the IIFE builds are unchanged.
- Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, on the first render, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it.

No speech worker starts, so no `worker-src blob:` CSP entry is needed.
- MathJax starts loading on the first render whatever the element holds, so math that appears later does not wait on the download. Renders without math return without waiting on it.
- The `./browser/*` exports declare `types`, pointing at the declarations of the matching `./delivery`, `./author`, `./controller` and `./print` entries.
- Elements declare React and React DOM as dependencies only. The React peer they also declared let pnpm and yarn bind an element to the host's React; each element now runs on the React 18 it installs.
- Keep MathJax 4 output intact on pages that also run MathJax 3: typeset output carries no `data-latex` attributes, and the MathJax the adapter loads writes its styles to `<style id="PIE-MJX-CHTML-styles">`. Such pages remain unsupported; the adapter logs one `console.error` naming the conflict and dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict` on `window` for each condition it detects (exported as `MATHJAX_CONFLICT_EVENT`).
- Fix `dist/index.iife.js`, which threw on load (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'isRequired')`) and never defined its global or element. The `prop-types` and `debug` stand-ins in the IIFE build now match the real packages' production behaviour.
- b6ef8b1: Element math rendered through a player's MathJax 3 renderer, as on `iife` pages, no longer logs an unsupported-page `console.error` or dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict`. The adapter still reports MathJax 4 meeting MathJax 3.
- Vendor the lodash helper surface through `@pie-element/shared-lodash` so browser ESM output no longer depends on runtime lodash or lodash-es resolution.
  
  Replace `@pie-lib/config-ui`'s tiny `mathjs` fraction-to-number usage with a generated local helper, while keeping `mathjs@^15.2.0` for packages such as `@pie-element/number-line` that use the broader math surface.

## 12.1.2-next.26

### Patch Changes

- 54541e0: Keep MathJax 4 output intact on pages that also run MathJax 3: typeset output carries no `data-latex` attributes, and the MathJax the adapter loads writes its styles to `<style id="PIE-MJX-CHTML-styles">`. Such pages remain unsupported; the adapter logs one `console.error` naming the conflict and dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict` on `window` for each condition it detects (exported as `MATHJAX_CONFLICT_EVENT`).

## 12.1.2-next.24

### Patch Changes

- 269257a: Elements declare React and React DOM as dependencies only. The React peer they also declared let pnpm and yarn bind an element to the host's React; each element now runs on the React 18 it installs.

## 12.1.2-next.21

### Patch Changes

- 80e386a: MathJax starts loading on the first render whatever the element holds, so math that appears later does not wait on the download. Renders without math return without waiting on it.

## 12.1.2-next.20

### Patch Changes

- 6ed08c4: Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, only for content that holds math, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it. As under IIFE, single `$…$` stays text unless the page sets `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering@2'] = { opts: { useSingleDollar: true } }`, `\abs` is defined, and math carries hidden MathML for screen readers with no tab stops and no generated speech. No speech worker starts, so no `worker-src blob:` CSP entry is needed.
- f64aeac: The `./browser/*` exports declare `types`, pointing at the declarations of the matching `./delivery`, `./author`, `./controller` and `./print` entries.

## 12.1.2-next.19

### Patch Changes

- c4e2ba3: Add `@pie-element/shared-editor-runtime`, one browser ESM build of the tiptap editor engine, and an editor-runtime variant of each browser view of the elements that bundle the engine, declared in `pie.browserEditorRuntime`, which `pie-cli` sync now writes. `./browser/*` and the IIFE builds are unchanged.

## 12.1.2-next.18

### Patch Changes

- 473da8e: Browser ESM and legacy print bundles install the stylesheets they import, MathQuill's among them, so math fields render styled in the player and in hosts that bundle the elements with Vite or webpack. MathQuill's font ships as a WOFF2 file beside the bundle.
- 7abcbd2: Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

## 12.1.2-next.7

### Patch Changes

- a644ec3: Declare react and react-dom as installable dependencies pinned to the browser ESM shared version (18.2.0), not peer-only. Legacy webpack bundlers install dependencies and never peers, so peer-only React left node_modules/react absent and every @mui/@emotion/@dnd-kit peer failed to resolve. Bundle output is unchanged - React stays external in every build.

## 14.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#330](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/330) [`8170ce7`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/8170ce7efe7a13675b914e8d187df23022bff8ab) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Region names, screen-reader headings, the teacher instructions, rationale and rubric toggles, the drawing-response tool names, the inline dropdown names, the math keypad instructions, the editor toolbar buttons and the chart and graph key legends follow the item language, in English and Spanish, and follow a language change after the first render. A two-part question also labels its parts in the item language. The drawing-response background image is decorative, so screen readers skip it.

- [#332](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/332) [`338861f`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/338861f5ff91ec4d46b567cf0c3ecafa8b2ac467) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Two items on one page, and the two parts of an EBSR item, now render every DOM id once. The item container and the enable-audio prompt take generated ids and keep their `main-container` and `play-audio-info` classes, which the elements look them up by. EBSR marks its parts with `data-part`, math-templated marks its answer blocks with `data-answer-block`, and a categorize category carries its model id as `data-category-id`. The annotation editor, the multi-trait rubric menus, the choice feedback menu and the hotspot toolbar icons take generated ids. Authored CSS that selects `#main-container`, `#play-audio-info` or an EBSR part by `#a` or `#b` must select the class or `[data-part]` instead.

- [#342](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/342) [`aa5e733`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/aa5e73381ee663671154b113d4cdd2b17f0fb06e) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - The custom audio play button on a prompt and the chart's Actions control are buttons a keyboard can reach and press with Enter or Space, with a visible focus ring and an accessible name in the item language ("Play audio", "Actions"). The Actions control tells screen readers whether its popover is open.

- [#268](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/268) [`cf1ccc0`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/cf1ccc0d25c0c136dc01dab014c68a083ed595ed) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - chore: remove upstream sync tooling (PIE-1144)

- [#325](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/325) [`56a9e32`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/56a9e32e5852cc23929369da487ee250084c2d89) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - fix: take the remaining element DOM ids from the shared unique-id helper

- [#374](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/374) [`c71aac6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/c71aac64875677926e30a7c4271c33b2ded5606f) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - fix(render-ui, theming): make feedback and correctness colours readable under every scheme

- [#376](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/376) [`dbaf591`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/dbaf5918e41c3aec101037e521972de636a74251) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - fix: theme the focus rings on choices, the inline dropdown, the math keypad and the MathJax explorer

## 14.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#261](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/261) [`29d19da`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/29d19daf732eb4cff629084534cdbf0d27f0acb1) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - First stable release built from pie-elements-ng, which replaces the pie-elements and pie-lib builds of this package.
  
  It is a new major version, above every version those repositories published, so existing `^` ranges on the earlier line keep resolving the earlier builds. Moving to this version is opt-in.

### Minor Changes

- [#193](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/193) [`7077034`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/7077034c1ab4fdda2e0bd844716aed79e4f02493) Thanks [@PatriciaRomaniuc](https://github.com/PatriciaRomaniuc)! - `completeAudioEnabled` now works on its own. With prompt audio present, the item only reports `complete: true` once the audio has played to the end, whether autoplay, the audio button or the native controls started it. Previously the setting only took effect when `autoplayAudioEnabled` was also on.
  
  Behaviour change for hosts that set `completeAudioEnabled` without `autoplayAudioEnabled`: those items no longer report complete right after a response; they wait for the prompt audio to finish. The "click to enable audio" overlay still only appears with autoplay on.

- [#59](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/59) [`fbf3695`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/fbf3695636c20afa6a31655c5f1a1d6ed130a374) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Trigger the next prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.

- [#59](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/59) [`d0f8d8e`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/d0f8d8ead911f8c6256a4898a2f6b6863b7538ac) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Trigger another prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.

- [#88](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/88) [`d6e12a5`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/d6e12a5e47e15a93507d7ef5a9eeeee02f230229) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - React element colours drawn from MUI's grey palette now follow the active colour scheme.
  
  `theme.palette.grey[N]` does not track `--pie-*`, so every one of these borders, fills
  and glyphs held a single hex under all ten schemes. Measured against each scheme's own
  `--pie-background`, the worst case per site ran between 1.01:1 and 1.72:1 — the
  answer-choice separator in `multiple-choice` that George reported was the visible end of
  it, not an isolated defect. Each site now reads the token matching its role, and the
  worst case across every scheme is at least 3.17:1.
  
  Strokes, dividers and connectors take `--pie-border`; the heavier card outlines in
  `math-inline` and `math-templated` take `--pie-border-dark`. Fills take
  `--pie-background-dark`, and selected or pressed fills `--pie-dropdown-background`. Text
  and interactive icons take `--pie-text` — no neutral token clears 4.5:1 in every scheme,
  so the `likert` column header that measured 1.88:1 on plain white gains contrast rather
  than keeping its tint. De-emphasised glyphs take `--pie-border-gray`, disabled
  affordances `--pie-disabled`.
  
  Four surfaces move with their strokes, because a scheme's border colour on a permanently
  white card is worse than the grey it replaced: under white-on-black `--pie-border` is
  `#ffffff`. The two `extended-text-entry` annotation popovers, the `inline-dropdown` menu
  item and the `config-ui` settings panel now paint `--pie-white`, which inverts with the
  scheme as `palette.common.white` never did.
  
  `@pie-lib/render-ui` gains `color.buttonFocusOutline()` for `--pie-button-focus-outline`,
  used by the two editor toolbar focus rings that were drawing themselves in `grey[700]` —
  1.28:1 on yellow-on-navy.
  
  Visible change in the default light theme: strokes that were `#e0e0e0` or `#bdbdbd` are
  now `--pie-border`, which resolves to `#8f8f8f`. That is deliberate; the previous values
  were below the 3:1 non-text minimum before any scheme was applied.

- [#95](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/95) [`a644ec3`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/a644ec3877219c3f9220483640ce031993441580) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Declare react and react-dom as installable dependencies pinned to the browser ESM shared version (18.2.0), not peer-only. Legacy webpack bundlers install dependencies and never peers, so peer-only React left node_modules/react absent and every @mui/@emotion/@dnd-kit peer failed to resolve. Bundle output is unchanged - React stays external in every build.

- [#120](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/120) [`9f6033c`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/9f6033c036503e667f21ee90399a7fc53fa6a3d8) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Restore the legacy print bundle (module/print.js) so print works with the current @pie-framework/pie-print client loader

- [#147](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/147) [`285c07c`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/285c07c8e426d64c63e0719f3046246068edae21) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - A coalesced `session-changed` is no longer dropped when the element is torn down inside its own debounce window (PIE-1058).
  
  `@pie-element/shared-player-events` gains `createSessionNotifier`, which registers each deferred notification against its host element. One `flushSessionNotifiers(this)` call in `disconnectedCallback` commits everything the element owns, and the helper installs `commitPendingSession()` for a player to call before discarding the element — while it is still attached, so the event still reaches a `document`-level host listener. The install wraps an element-declared method of the same name, and disposing the last notifier removes it again, so a player never counts an element as committed while a pending dispatch is dropped. A dispatch that throws is reported through `onDispatchError`, defaulting to `console.warn`.
  
  All five elements that coalesced their session write adopt it. `extended-text-entry` and `explicit-constructed-response` also move their debounce off the value path onto the dispatch, so `.session` holds the response as soon as the editor commits it. No debounce delay changes.

- [#265](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/265) [`82406bf`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/82406bf47738f81d020706b639f5f22748bcd5d0) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Merge pull request [#175](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/issues/175) from pie-framework/fix/author-shim-cross-element-bundles

- [#195](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/195) [`473da8e`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/473da8e7c62e0ffd80001673c2df4fab79d2ec4d) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Browser ESM and legacy print bundles install the stylesheets they import, MathQuill's among them, so math fields render styled in the player and in hosts that bundle the elements with Vite or webpack. MathQuill's font ships as a WOFF2 file beside the bundle.

- [#198](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/198) [`7abcbd2`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/7abcbd20a631a99df3c58158eaee953596615633) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

- [#265](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/265) [`7f5b63d`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/7f5b63d4207ab434d313295a9cf582fc612e14ba) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Merge pull request [#131](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/issues/131) from pie-framework/dependabot/bun/vitejs/plugin-react-6.1.1

- [#199](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/199) [`c4e2ba3`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/c4e2ba313d3137c90af800715606e3f372e4beac) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Add `@pie-element/shared-editor-runtime`, one browser ESM build of the tiptap editor engine, and an editor-runtime variant of each browser view of the elements that bundle the engine, declared in `pie.browserEditorRuntime`, which `pie-cli` sync now writes. `./browser/*` and the IIFE builds are unchanged.

- [#205](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/205) [`6ed08c4`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/6ed08c43bbfd26b6bcc34f50e0e6760ec02fe704) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, on the first render, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it. As under IIFE, single `$…$` stays text unless the page sets `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering@2'] = { opts: { useSingleDollar: true } }`, `\abs` is defined, and math carries hidden MathML for screen readers with no tab stops and no generated speech. No speech worker starts, so no `worker-src blob:` CSP entry is needed.

- [#208](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/208) [`80e386a`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/80e386ac213e0ed6e19168fa12d9e9e08e64c0b6) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - MathJax starts loading on the first render whatever the element holds, so math that appears later does not wait on the download. Renders without math return without waiting on it.

- [#203](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/203) [`1ecdcf5`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/1ecdcf5e66d6f87e4bdfeea54b1228c00bd01ac9) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - The instructor role no longer locks the choice order, as in pie-elements: an instructor sees the order stored in the session, and a session with none gets a new shuffle, saved as for a student. inline-dropdown still shows an instructor the authored order in view and evaluate mode while choice rationales are enabled. A host that wants the authored order sets `env['@pie-element'].lockChoiceOrder`. (PIE-714)

- [#203](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/203) [`24caee6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/24caee65b3f6bc3ae0c0682da71b1ee01f160fb4) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - A session without an `id` or `element` keeps its shuffled choice order across renders. The order is saved through `updateSession`, which receives both as `undefined`, as in pie-elements.

- [#204](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/204) [`f64aeac`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/f64aeac84eef164000a855e6ac2842d0067e26aa) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - The `./browser/*` exports declare `types`, pointing at the declarations of the matching `./delivery`, `./author`, `./controller` and `./print` entries.

- [#217](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/217) [`269257a`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/269257a68d5aa5c5211b0e119b2f83927bfcde50) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Elements declare React and React DOM as dependencies only. The React peer they also declared let pnpm and yarn bind an element to the host's React; each element now runs on the React 18 it installs.

- [#225](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/225) [`54541e0`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/54541e041f18eeb625b517d95387e05102ce3e02) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Keep MathJax 4 output intact on pages that also run MathJax 3: typeset output carries no `data-latex` attributes, and the MathJax the adapter loads writes its styles to `<style id="PIE-MJX-CHTML-styles">`. Such pages remain unsupported; the adapter logs one `console.error` naming the conflict and dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict` on `window` for each condition it detects (exported as `MATHJAX_CONFLICT_EVENT`).

- [#209](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/209) [`76a2592`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/76a2592d4e46392e148c6e31b7559dfec3a95296) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Fix `dist/index.iife.js`, which threw on load (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'isRequired')`) and never defined its global or element. The `prop-types` and `debug` stand-ins in the IIFE build now match the real packages' production behaviour.

- [#232](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/232) [`b6ef8b1`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/b6ef8b1c432787df49293b9271b4bace5cd60d50) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Element math rendered through a player's MathJax 3 renderer, as on `iife` pages, no longer logs an unsupported-page `console.error` or dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict`. The adapter still reports MathJax 4 meeting MathJax 3.

- [#248](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/248) [`3bad6b6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/3bad6b6d27789a9c7d165d465f4846ce6d97d651) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Print modules rendered by the `@pie-framework/pie-print` print player typeset their math through that player's renderer, waiting up to 10 seconds while the player imports it. Math previously stayed untypeset there, because the element's MathJax 4 does not start on a page that already holds the player's MathJax 3.

- [#251](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/251) [`cd1f4f9`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/cd1f4f9c26d72be0a486ab17d8d56ba529056755) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - When a page installs the adapter's own `renderMath` as its math renderer, at `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering']` or, for elements inside `<pie-print>`, at `window.renderMath`, the adapter now typesets with its own MathJax. It previously called itself without end, which overflowed the stack or hung the page.

  later model or session write, or reinserting the element, no longer throws React
  error [#409](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/issues/409). A render still pending from before removal is cancelled, and a
  reinserted element renders again.

  subpaths from what a package declares.
  
  An alias-based IIFE builder resolves `@pie-element/<element>/print` as a filesystem path
  and never reads the exports map, so print needs the same root shim `controller.js` and
  `configure.js` already provide. Without it the subpath resolved only from TypeScript
  sources, so print worked in a workspace build and failed every build against published
  tarballs — taking the whole bundle with it rather than just the print view.

  Replace `@pie-lib/config-ui`'s tiny `mathjs` fraction-to-number usage with a generated local helper, while keeping `mathjs@^15.2.0` for packages such as `@pie-element/number-line` that use the broader math surface.

### Minor Changes

- `completeAudioEnabled` now works on its own. With prompt audio present, the item only reports `complete: true` once the audio has played to the end, whether autoplay, the audio button or the native controls started it. Previously the setting only took effect when `autoplayAudioEnabled` was also on.
  
  Behaviour change for hosts that set `completeAudioEnabled` without `autoplayAudioEnabled`: those items no longer report complete right after a response; they wait for the prompt audio to finish. The "click to enable audio" overlay still only appears with autoplay on.

### Patch Changes

- multiple-choice release flow test
- Include changes and fix dependency issues
- define and enforce packaging contracts PIE-626
- Publish corrected React element next prereleases from stable npm baselines.
- Prepare all PIE element packages for the next prerelease patch wave
- Trigger the next prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.
- Trigger another prerelease patch for all PIE element packages.
- React element colours drawn from MUI's grey palette now follow the active colour scheme.
  
  `theme.palette.grey[N]` does not track `--pie-*`, so every one of these borders, fills
  and glyphs held a single hex under all ten schemes. Measured against each scheme's own
  `--pie-background`, the worst case per site ran between 1.01:1 and 1.72:1 — the
  answer-choice separator in `multiple-choice` that George reported was the visible end of
  it, not an isolated defect. Each site now reads the token matching its role, and the
  worst case across every scheme is at least 3.17:1.
  
  Strokes, dividers and connectors take `--pie-border`; the heavier card outlines in
  `math-inline` and `math-templated` take `--pie-border-dark`. Fills take
  `--pie-background-dark`, and selected or pressed fills `--pie-dropdown-background`. Text
  and interactive icons take `--pie-text` — no neutral token clears 4.5:1 in every scheme,
  so the `likert` column header that measured 1.88:1 on plain white gains contrast rather
  than keeping its tint. De-emphasised glyphs take `--pie-border-gray`, disabled
  affordances `--pie-disabled`.
  
  Four surfaces move with their strokes, because a scheme's border colour on a permanently
  white card is worse than the grey it replaced: under white-on-black `--pie-border` is
  `#ffffff`. The two `extended-text-entry` annotation popovers, the `inline-dropdown` menu
  item and the `config-ui` settings panel now paint `--pie-white`, which inverts with the
  scheme as `palette.common.white` never did.
  
  `@pie-lib/render-ui` gains `color.buttonFocusOutline()` for `--pie-button-focus-outline`,
  used by the two editor toolbar focus rings that were drawing themselves in `grey[700]` —
  1.28:1 on yellow-on-navy.
  
  Visible change in the default light theme: strokes that were `#e0e0e0` or `#bdbdbd` are
  now `--pie-border`, which resolves to `#8f8f8f`. That is deliberate; the previous values
  were below the 3:1 non-text minimum before any scheme was applied.
- Declare react and react-dom as installable dependencies pinned to the browser ESM shared version (18.2.0), not peer-only. Legacy webpack bundlers install dependencies and never peers, so peer-only React left node_modules/react absent and every @mui/@emotion/@dnd-kit peer failed to resolve. Bundle output is unchanged - React stays external in every build.
- Restore the legacy print bundle (module/print.js) so print works with the current @pie-framework/pie-print client loader
- A coalesced `session-changed` is no longer dropped when the element is torn down inside its own debounce window (PIE-1058).
  
  `@pie-element/shared-player-events` gains `createSessionNotifier`, which registers each deferred notification against its host element. One `flushSessionNotifiers(this)` call in `disconnectedCallback` commits everything the element owns, and the helper installs `commitPendingSession()` for a player to call before discarding the element — while it is still attached, so the event still reaches a `document`-level host listener. The install wraps an element-declared method of the same name, and disposing the last notifier removes it again, so a player never counts an element as committed while a pending dispatch is dropped. A dispatch that throws is reported through `onDispatchError`, defaulting to `console.warn`.
  
  All five elements that coalesced their session write adopt it. `extended-text-entry` and `explicit-constructed-response` also move their debounce off the value path onto the dispatch, so `.session` holds the response as soon as the editor commits it. No debounce delay changes.
- Merge pull request #175 from pie-framework/fix/author-shim-cross-element-bundles
- Browser ESM and legacy print bundles install the stylesheets they import, MathQuill's among them, so math fields render styled in the player and in hosts that bundle the elements with Vite or webpack. MathQuill's font ships as a WOFF2 file beside the bundle.
- Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

- Add `@pie-element/shared-editor-runtime`, one browser ESM build of the tiptap editor engine, and an editor-runtime variant of each browser view of the elements that bundle the engine, declared in `pie.browserEditorRuntime`, which `pie-cli` sync now writes. `./browser/*` and the IIFE builds are unchanged.
- Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, on the first render, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it. As under IIFE, single `$…$` stays text unless the page sets `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering@2'] = { opts: { useSingleDollar: true } }`, `\abs` is defined, and math carries hidden MathML for screen readers with no tab stops and no generated speech. No speech worker starts, so no `worker-src blob:` CSP entry is needed.
- MathJax starts loading on the first render whatever the element holds, so math that appears later does not wait on the download. Renders without math return without waiting on it.
- The instructor role no longer locks the choice order, as in pie-elements: an instructor sees the order stored in the session, and a session with none gets a new shuffle, saved as for a student. inline-dropdown still shows an instructor the authored order in view and evaluate mode while choice rationales are enabled. A host that wants the authored order sets `env['@pie-element'].lockChoiceOrder`. (PIE-714)
- A session without an `id` or `element` keeps its shuffled choice order across renders. The order is saved through `updateSession`, which receives both as `undefined`, as in pie-elements.
- The `./browser/*` exports declare `types`, pointing at the declarations of the matching `./delivery`, `./author`, `./controller` and `./print` entries.
- Elements declare React and React DOM as dependencies only. The React peer they also declared let pnpm and yarn bind an element to the host's React; each element now runs on the React 18 it installs.
- Keep MathJax 4 output intact on pages that also run MathJax 3: typeset output carries no `data-latex` attributes, and the MathJax the adapter loads writes its styles to `<style id="PIE-MJX-CHTML-styles">`. Such pages remain unsupported; the adapter logs one `console.error` naming the conflict and dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict` on `window` for each condition it detects (exported as `MATHJAX_CONFLICT_EVENT`).
- Fix `dist/index.iife.js`, which threw on load (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'isRequired')`) and never defined its global or element. The `prop-types` and `debug` stand-ins in the IIFE build now match the real packages' production behaviour.
- b6ef8b1: Element math rendered through a player's MathJax 3 renderer, as on `iife` pages, no longer logs an unsupported-page `console.error` or dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict`. The adapter still reports MathJax 4 meeting MathJax 3.
- 307d489: Removing an element no longer leaves it holding an unmounted React root, so a
  later model or session write, or reinserting the element, no longer throws React
  error #409. A render still pending from before removal is cancelled, and a
  reinserted element renders again.

- Publish a root `print.js` shim from print-bearing elements, and resolve bundler entry
  subpaths from what a package declares.
  
  An alias-based IIFE builder resolves `@pie-element/<element>/print` as a filesystem path
  and never reads the exports map, so print needs the same root shim `controller.js` and
  `configure.js` already provide. Without it the subpath resolved only from TypeScript
  sources, so print worked in a workspace build and failed every build against published
  tarballs — taking the whole bundle with it rather than just the print view.
- Vendor the lodash helper surface through `@pie-element/shared-lodash` so browser ESM output no longer depends on runtime lodash or lodash-es resolution.
  
  Replace `@pie-lib/config-ui`'s tiny `mathjs` fraction-to-number usage with a generated local helper, while keeping `mathjs@^15.2.0` for packages such as `@pie-element/number-line` that use the broader math surface.

## 13.4.0-next.14

### Patch Changes

- 473da8e: Browser ESM and legacy print bundles install the stylesheets they import, MathQuill's among them, so math fields render styled in the player and in hosts that bundle the elements with Vite or webpack. MathQuill's font ships as a WOFF2 file beside the bundle.
- 7abcbd2: Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

## 13.4.0-next.13

### Minor Changes

- 7077034: `completeAudioEnabled` now works on its own. With prompt audio present, the item only reports `complete: true` once the audio has played to the end, whether autoplay, the audio button or the native controls started it. Previously the setting only took effect when `autoplayAudioEnabled` was also on.

  Behaviour change for hosts that set `completeAudioEnabled` without `autoplayAudioEnabled`: those items no longer report complete right after a response; they wait for the prompt audio to finish. The "click to enable audio" overlay still only appears with autoplay on.

## 13.3.5-next.7

### Patch Changes

- 285c07c: A coalesced `session-changed` is no longer dropped when the element is torn down inside its own debounce window (PIE-1058).

  `@pie-element/shared-player-events` gains `createSessionNotifier`, which registers each deferred notification against its host element. One `flushSessionNotifiers(this)` call in `disconnectedCallback` commits everything the element owns, and the helper installs `commitPendingSession()` for a player to call before discarding the element — while it is still attached, so the event still reaches a `document`-level host listener. The install wraps an element-declared method of the same name, and disposing the last notifier removes it again, so a player never counts an element as committed while a pending dispatch is dropped. A dispatch that throws is reported through `onDispatchError`, defaulting to `console.warn`.

  All five elements that coalesced their session write adopt it. `extended-text-entry` and `explicit-constructed-response` also move their debounce off the value path onto the dispatch, so `.session` holds the response as soon as the editor commits it. No debounce delay changes.

### Patch Changes

- a644ec3: Declare react and react-dom as installable dependencies pinned to the browser ESM shared version (18.2.0), not peer-only. Legacy webpack bundlers install dependencies and never peers, so peer-only React left node_modules/react absent and every @mui/@emotion/@dnd-kit peer failed to resolve. Bundle output is unchanged - React stays external in every build.

## 13.3.5-next.1

### Patch Changes

- d6e12a5: React element colours drawn from MUI's grey palette now follow the active colour scheme.

  `theme.palette.grey[N]` does not track `--pie-*`, so every one of these borders, fills
  and glyphs held a single hex under all ten schemes. Measured against each scheme's own
  `--pie-background`, the worst case per site ran between 1.01:1 and 1.72:1 — the
  answer-choice separator in `multiple-choice` that George reported was the visible end of
  it, not an isolated defect. Each site now reads the token matching its role, and the
  worst case across every scheme is at least 3.17:1.

  Strokes, dividers and connectors take `--pie-border`; the heavier card outlines in
  `math-inline` and `math-templated` take `--pie-border-dark`. Fills take
  `--pie-background-dark`, and selected or pressed fills `--pie-dropdown-background`. Text
  and interactive icons take `--pie-text` — no neutral token clears 4.5:1 in every scheme,
  so the `likert` column header that measured 1.88:1 on plain white gains contrast rather
  than keeping its tint. De-emphasised glyphs take `--pie-border-gray`, disabled
  affordances `--pie-disabled`.

  Four surfaces move with their strokes, because a scheme's border colour on a permanently
  white card is worse than the grey it replaced: under white-on-black `--pie-border` is
  `#ffffff`. The two `extended-text-entry` annotation popovers, the `inline-dropdown` menu
  item and the `config-ui` settings panel now paint `--pie-white`, which inverts with the
  scheme as `palette.common.white` never did.

  `@pie-lib/render-ui` gains `color.buttonFocusOutline()` for `--pie-button-focus-outline`,
  used by the two editor toolbar focus rings that were drawing themselves in `grey[700]` —
  1.28:1 on yellow-on-navy.

  Visible change in the default light theme: strokes that were `#e0e0e0` or `#bdbdbd` are
  now `--pie-border`, which resolves to `#8f8f8f`. That is deliberate; the previous values
  were below the 3:1 non-text minimum before any scheme was applied.

### Patch Changes

- Add a legacy-compatible `module/print.js` print artifact (self-contained,
  React inlined, zero externals) so print works through the unmodified
  `@pie-framework/pie-print` client loader used in production today, in
  addition to the existing `dist/browser/print/index.js` artifact for the
  new `pie-print-player`. Manual ng-tagged release for verification ahead of
  a standard prerelease. PIE-839.
- Sync latest fixes from upstream `pie-elements`: correct `radio` mode's
  `maxSelections` handling (a single radio selection no longer triggers the
  max-selections error state or blocks re-selection), and a new controller
  validation warning when the number of authored correct answers exceeds
  `maxSelections` for non-radio choice modes.

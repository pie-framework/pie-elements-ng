# @pie-element/shared-controller-utils

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#23](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/23) [`509caf6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/509caf638617921bb62037b4e0d5d69b5bdca37d) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Fix: republish to replace workspace:* with resolved versions in published manifests

- [#27](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/27) [`5ca8ec1`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/5ca8ec140ac4b115c8d11cb783d856be42f3de7b) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Republish shared packages with resolved workspace:* dependencies (fixes broken 0.1.0 manifests on npm)

- [#198](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/198) [`7abcbd2`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/7abcbd20a631a99df3c58158eaee953596615633) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

- [#203](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/203) [`1ecdcf5`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/1ecdcf5e66d6f87e4bdfeea54b1228c00bd01ac9) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - The instructor role no longer locks the choice order, as in pie-elements: an instructor sees the order stored in the session, and a session with none gets a new shuffle, saved as for a student. inline-dropdown still shows an instructor the authored order in view and evaluate mode while choice rationales are enabled. A host that wants the authored order sets `env['@pie-element'].lockChoiceOrder`. (PIE-714)

- [#203](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/203) [`24caee6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/24caee65b3f6bc3ae0c0682da71b1ee01f160fb4) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - The shuffled choice order is saved through `updateSession`, so the next render shows the same order. These elements shuffle each part separately and never saved the result, so every render shuffled again.

The order is saved through `updateSession`, which receives both as `undefined`, as in pie-elements.

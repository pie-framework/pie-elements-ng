# @pie-element/shared-math-rendering-mathjax

## 0.1.1-next.3

### Patch Changes

- 6ed08c4: Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, only for content that holds math, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it. As under IIFE, single `$…$` stays text unless the page sets `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering@2'] = { opts: { useSingleDollar: true } }`, `\abs` is defined, and math carries hidden MathML for screen readers with no tab stops and no generated speech. No speech worker starts, so no `worker-src blob:` CSP entry is needed.

## 0.1.1-next.2

### Patch Changes

- 7abcbd2: Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

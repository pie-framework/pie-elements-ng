# @pie-element/shared-math-rendering-mathjax

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/59) [`e6ef621`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/e6ef621171a160d8bbcbf6972a454f68e155548a) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Delegate ESM math rendering to the player-owned renderer with standalone fallback

- [#198](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/198) [`7abcbd2`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/7abcbd20a631a99df3c58158eaee953596615633) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Element packages export `./package.json` and accept React 18.2 or 19 as peers, and the React libraries they use accept React 19. `@emotion/style` and `@pie-lib/test-utils` are gone from runtime dependencies. Multiple choice dispatches `session-changed` when the student answers and no longer when its session is set, and EBSR's session holds a part's answer as soon as the part records it. MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.

- [#265](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/265) [`303496f`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/303496f4da5b06cdf479ee4f184b07200bf34b53) Thanks [@CarlaCostea](https://github.com/CarlaCostea)! - Merge pull request [#193](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/issues/193) from pie-framework/feat/PIE-1085

- [#205](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/205) [`6ed08c4`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/6ed08c43bbfd26b6bcc34f50e0e6760ec02fe704) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, on the first render, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it. As under IIFE, single `$…$` stays text unless the page sets `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering@2'] = { opts: { useSingleDollar: true } }`, `\abs` is defined, and math carries hidden MathML for screen readers with no tab stops and no generated speech. No speech worker starts, so no `worker-src blob:` CSP entry is needed.

- [#208](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/208) [`80e386a`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/80e386ac213e0ed6e19168fa12d9e9e08e64c0b6) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - MathJax starts loading on the first render whatever the element holds, so math that appears later does not wait on the download. Renders without math return without waiting on it.

- [#225](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/225) [`54541e0`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/54541e041f18eeb625b517d95387e05102ce3e02) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Keep MathJax 4 output intact on pages that also run MathJax 3: typeset output carries no `data-latex` attributes, and the MathJax the adapter loads writes its styles to `<style id="PIE-MJX-CHTML-styles">`. Such pages remain unsupported; the adapter logs one `console.error` naming the conflict and dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict` on `window` for each condition it detects (exported as `MATHJAX_CONFLICT_EVENT`).

- [#232](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/232) [`b6ef8b1`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/b6ef8b1c432787df49293b9271b4bace5cd60d50) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Element math rendered through a player's MathJax 3 renderer, as on `iife` pages, no longer logs an unsupported-page `console.error` or dispatches `pie-mathjax-version-conflict`. The adapter still reports MathJax 4 meeting MathJax 3.

- [#248](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/248) [`3bad6b6`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/3bad6b6d27789a9c7d165d465f4846ce6d97d651) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - Print modules rendered by the `@pie-framework/pie-print` print player typeset their math through that player's renderer, waiting up to 10 seconds while the player imports it. Math previously stayed untypeset there, because the element's MathJax 4 does not start on a page that already holds the player's MathJax 3.

- [#251](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/pull/251) [`cd1f4f9`](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-elements-ng/commit/cd1f4f9c26d72be0a486ab17d8d56ba529056755) Thanks [@chillenious](https://github.com/chillenious)! - When a page installs the adapter's own `renderMath` as its math renderer, at `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering']` or, for elements inside `<pie-print>`, at `window.renderMath`, the adapter now typesets with its own MathJax. It previously called itself without end, which overflowed the stack or hung the page.

## 0.1.1-next.8

### Patch Changes

- cd1f4f9: When a page installs the adapter's own `renderMath` as its math renderer, at `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering']` or, for elements inside `<pie-print>`, at `window.renderMath`, the adapter now typesets with its own MathJax. It previously called itself without end, which overflowed the stack or hung the page.

## 0.1.1-next.6

### Patch Changes

MathJax initializes once per page, and `PieUpdateSession` types the `updateSession(id, element, properties)` call controllers make.
- Merge pull request #193 from pie-framework/feat/PIE-1085
- Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, on the first render, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it. As under IIFE, single `$…$` stays text unless the page sets `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering@2'] = { opts: { useSingleDollar: true } }`, `\abs` is defined, and math carries hidden MathML for screen readers with no tab stops and no generated speech.

## 0.1.1-next.3

### Patch Changes

- 6ed08c4: Where no player renderer is installed on the page, as under `strategy="esm"`, elements load MathJax 4.1.3 (`tex-mml-chtml.js` on jsDelivr unless `srcUrl` overrides it) once per page, only for content that holds math, and typeset just the element they render once MathJax has started; host page text is no longer typeset, and a MathJax the page loads itself is used as the page configured it. As under IIFE, single `$…$` stays text unless the page sets `window['@pie-lib/math-rendering@2'] = { opts: { useSingleDollar: true } }`, `\abs` is defined, and math carries hidden MathML for screen readers with no tab stops and no generated speech.

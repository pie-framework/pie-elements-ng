# @pie-element/shared-theming

## 0.2.0-next.5

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7abcbd2]
  - @pie-element/shared-types@0.2.0-next.1

## 0.2.0-next.4

### Patch Changes

- 2f26122: Add a `disabled-text` color for disabled text that still has to be read, and use it for charting tick labels (PIE-922)

  `@pie-lib/render-ui` gains `color.disabledText()` (`--pie-disabled-text`, default
  `#545454`), registered in `@pie-element/shared-theming` and set in the light and dark
  themes. Charting's disabled tick labels took two different colors: the MathJax fraction
  variant used the `disabled` grey, while the plain-text variant fell through to the
  browser's own disabled-input color. Both now use `disabled-text`, which stays dimmed but
  keeps text-grade contrast - the `disabled` grey is 3.94:1 on white, below WCAG AA for
  normal text, and fraction numerals render smaller still.

## 0.2.0-next.3

### Minor Changes

- 7cae8f9: Add a surface theming token and use it for drag placeholders, so placeholder fills come from the theme instead of hard-coded greys (PIE-865, PIE-870, PIE-874, PIE-878)

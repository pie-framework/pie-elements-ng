# PIE Elements NG

This project is meant to eventually replace the current pie-elements project with the following improvements:

- Current libraries (work underway in pie-elements to upgrade React, MUI, migrate to Tiptap, etc)
- PIE full on board with ESM
- Vite builds, improved tools (like CLI support, demos, etc)
- Better testing support

It includes scripting to help pie-elements migrate to this project.

TODO [fill in more documentation when this comes closer to switching to]

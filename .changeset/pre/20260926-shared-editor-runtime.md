Add `@pie-element/shared-editor-runtime`, one browser ESM build of the tiptap editor engine, and an editor-runtime variant of each browser view of the elements that bundle the engine, declared in `pie.browserEditorRuntime`, which `pie-cli` sync now writes. `./browser/*` and the IIFE builds are unchanged.

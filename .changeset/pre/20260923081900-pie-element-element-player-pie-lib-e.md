Pin every @tiptap/\* dependency to exactly 3.31.3, so installing more than one PIE element resolves a single @tiptap/core instead of three. tiptap pins its own peers exactly from 3.24.0 on, so a mixed set cannot be satisfied and the duplicate core breaks ProseMirror on schema and plugin identity. Also dedupes prosemirror-model and prosemirror-view, which tiptap was warning about ("wrapping and splitting nodes will fail"). element-player drops its 8 @tiptap/\* dependencies plus lowlight and highlight.js: they were only reachable from an orphaned JsonEditor/ModelInspector pair that nothing imported, so none of them ever reached its bundle (PIE-1042)

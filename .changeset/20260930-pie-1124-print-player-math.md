Print modules rendered by the `@pie-framework/pie-print` print player typeset their math through that player's renderer, waiting up to 10 seconds while the player imports it. Math previously stayed untypeset there, because the element's MathJax 4 does not start on a page that already holds the player's MathJax 3.

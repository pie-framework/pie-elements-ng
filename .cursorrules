IE elements-ng project rules

- Web components: set data via element properties, not attributes.
- For custom elements, prefer imperative property updates (element.model = ..., element.session = ...).
- When changing model/session, reassign a new object if needed to trigger reactivity.
- Element player should rebuild the view model via controller.model(...) on mode or session changes.
- Avoid reactive loops when controller updates session; guard against re-setting identical session objects.
- Many element packages are synced from upstream; avoid manual edits in auto-generated files unless requested.
